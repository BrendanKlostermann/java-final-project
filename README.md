# Final Project

This is the final project for my CIS-171 Java course at Kirkwood Community College. Below is a journal of all the things I learned throughout the class.

## Introduction

In the first week of class I learned that Java functions pretty similarly to Python but uses different syntax. So far we have learned some of the basic fundamentals of Java and how they differ from Python, the previous language I learned. Things such as `Print('Hello World')` are a bit different in Java `System.out.println('Hello World')`. Its a little more typing but nothing dramatially different. Th biggest difference I've noticed so far is user input. It no longer gets controlled by the input command rather it uses the Scanner function in Java. From what I've seen so far the scanner function is imported and then a new scanner is set as a variable because it is faster and easier to use it that way. But you also can't have output text in the same line of code as the input scanner. You must ouput the question and set the scanner to pick up input on seperate lines. So far I feel that Java is a more complicated language than python but I also feel it isnt terribly hard to understand.
